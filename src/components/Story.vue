    h2.accent--text.mb-2 The Smellydog Story
    p My wife is a cat person. &nbsp; As such, it is her belief that 'dogs smell'. &nbsp; When she tells me this, my response is always 'yes, they smell like dogs.' &nbsp; Of course, I'm a dog person so it's probably not much of a surprise that I don't think that most dogs smell bad (though I have met some very fragrant exceptions over the years.)
    p I'm a lot like a dog in many ways. &nbsp; I'm protective of my friends and loved ones, I tend to 'follow my nose', I have a tendancy to 'herd' my wife through the parking lot (which has annoyed her on more than one occasion), and I tend to be a happy-go-lucky (and at times a bit derpy) kind of guy.
    p It is for these reasons (and probably more) that my wife refers to me as her 'big smelly sheepdog'. &nbsp; When it was time to create my website, I decided that a big smelly dog that strives to write clean code made for a good theme.  Thus Smellydog Coding was born.
    p I would like to point out that I don't actually smell (most days) since I do bathe regularly. &nbsp; Taco Tuesday is another story...
    p I've always been interested in technology (read: computer geek), but my current career (and life) took me in a different direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I've decided to change direction and follow my passion for coding by becoming a full time developer.
